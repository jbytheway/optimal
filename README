Optimal
=======

Optimal is a library for parsing options in configuration files or on the
command line.  Although several such libraries already exist, none of the
others offer all the features that optimal does (of course, they do tend to
offer features that optimal doesn't).

Since all sensible names for such libraries are already taken, I chose the
first word that came to mind beginning with 'opt'.
