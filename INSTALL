This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Then it should be simply

$ make

Further configuration (e.g. if you want to use a different compiler) goes in
user.mk.  See makeshift/INSTALL for details.
